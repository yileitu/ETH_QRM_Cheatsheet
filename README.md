## ETH QRM Cheatsheet

This project corresponds to the course Quantitative Risk Management 2022 Spring (AKA QRM) taught by [Prof. Patrick Cheridito](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~patrickc/) at ETH Zurich.  For course details, please see [here]( https://people.math.ethz.ch/~patrickc/qrm/).

Contents of this Cheatsheet are directly quoted from lecture slides and exercise sets of the QRM course and are thus copyrighted by the professor and TA of this course.

 - Q: QRM allows written aids of 10 single-sided A4 pages, However, there are 18 pages in total for this cheatsheet. How to deal with it?
 - A: You can print it out 1-by-2 pages per sheet. Believe me, these printed words are still visible to the naked eye. On top of that, you still have one page of written aids left to play with. Have fun!
